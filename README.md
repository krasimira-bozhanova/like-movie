# like-movie

Like-Movie is a movies recommender system. It is a website for personalized movie recommendations to users which uses collaborative filtering to produce the recommendations. 


## Database

The database is built using data dumps from Wikipedia. The idea is to make use of the Wikipedia's users' edits and interpret them as a sign of interest to the movie. Based on that we build these 'artificial' user profiles and use them in the collaborative filtering recommendations.
